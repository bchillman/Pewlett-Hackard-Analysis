# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis
## Overview



## Overview
This analysis was done for the purpose of determining more information about how many employees in Pewlett-Hackard will be retiring soon. As initial analysis showed that there would be a large number of these retirees, it was deemed important to find out more information about this so-called "Silver Tsunami." The following queries were made:

1. A table with all employees born from 1952 to 1955, and their titles
2. The same table, but only including the employees' current titles
3. The number of retiring employees grouped by their title
3. A table with all employees born in 1965, as those employees are deemed the correct age for mentoring new employees.
